# Test Assessment

## Task
1. The list of NFTs should be displayed as a grid of cards, with each card displaying the
NFT's details.
2. When a user clicks on a card, a modal should be displayed that shows more details
about the NFT, such as its description and the owner's address.
3. The modal should have a button that allows the user to purchase the NFT. Clicking
the button should navigate them to the relevant OpenSea page.
4. The design of the grid of cards and the modal is up to you, but it should be visually
appealing and easy to use.
